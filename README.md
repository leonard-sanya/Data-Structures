# Data-Structures


This repository contains implementations of various data structures from scratch in Python, designed for educational purposes. It includes fundamental structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues and trees. Each data structure is implemented in a clear and concise manner, with accompanying comments and example usage. These implementations provide a solid foundation for understanding how these structures work internally, helping to reinforce key computer science concepts. This repository is an excellent resource for students and developers looking to deepen their understanding of data structures without relying on external libraries.
